Independent Biomechanics Project by Ariyan Saha

Overview:
This project analyzes the 2D trajectory, velocity, and acceleration of two football free kicks using video-based motion tracking. Frame-by-frame coordinates were extracted and processed using numerical differentiation with smoothing filters.

Contents:
/report – Full analysis
/data – Raw coordinate tables, source video
/graphs – Trajectory, velocity, acceleration plots


Methodology:
Frame extraction and tracking
Position → velocity → acceleration derivation
Moving average smoothing
Horizontal vs vertical component analysis
Basic aerodynamic interpretation (Magnus effect)

Key Findings:
The analysis successfully isolated the physical differences in impulse required for each shot, while also demonstrating the critical importance of systematic error analysis in sports biomechanics.
