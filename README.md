Independent Biomechanics Project by Ariyan Saha

Overview
This project analyzes the 2D trajectory, velocity, and acceleration of a football free kick using video-based motion tracking. Frame-by-frame coordinates were extracted and processed using numerical differentiation with smoothing filters.

/data – Raw coordinate tables, source video
/graphs – Trajectory, velocity, acceleration plots


Methodology
Frame extraction and tracking
Position → velocity → acceleration derivation
Moving average smoothing
Horizontal vs vertical component analysis
Basic aerodynamic interpretation (Magnus effect)

Key Findings
Sharp velocity spike at impact (~0.300 s)
Significant acceleration due to impulse
Slight curved path due to sidespin
Vertical acceleration explains lift phase
